# predicting-housing-values
A machine learning project to predict housing prices using multiple regression models.

## 🔍 Overview
We used regression models like:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## 📁 Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw data
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for EDA and model training
- `src/`: Python scripts for preprocessing and modeling
- `results/`: Model evaluations, plots, and results

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Install requirements:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebooks or scripts

## 📊 Results
See `results/evaluation_metrics.md` for a summary of model performance.

## 📈 Sample Output
- Feature importance
- Actual vs. Predicted plots
